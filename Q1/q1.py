# 1.	In Folder Q1, there is a dataset in which we aim to estimate the house price using two features: the number of bedrooms and the basement area.

# Use Multiple Linear Regression for this task. Display the coefficients of the model and calculate the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error). Search about RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and explain the trade-offs between these metrics. Finally report RMSE score of your model.
# Perform this task using both LinearRegression and SGDRegressor.
# Additionally, study the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) metric using this link, and apply it to evaluate your model.

# RMSE is calculated as the square root of the Mean Squared Error (MSE). It penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring process and is expressed in the same units as the predicted variable, making it easy to interpret.

# MAE simply calculates the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. It treats all errors equally, which makes it more robust to outliers. The downside is that it doesnâ€™t reflect how far off large errors may be.

# MSE also penalizes larger errors more heavily, but its values are in squared units, which can make them harder to interpret directly.
